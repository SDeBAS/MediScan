<!-- Intel one api -->
## Intel oneAPI <img src="images/oneapi2.png" alt="png" width="30">
Intel OneAPI is a comprehensive development platform for building high-performance, cross-architecture applications. It provides a unified programming model, tools, and libraries that allow developers to optimize their applications for Intel CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other hardware. Intel OneAPI includes support for popular programming languages like C++, Python, and Fortran, as well as frameworks for deep learning, high-performance computing, and data analytics. With Intel OneAPI, developers can build applications that can run on a variety of hardware platforms, from edge devices to data centers, and take advantage of the performance benefits of Intel architectures.

### Use of oneDNN and TensorFlow in our project
<img src="images/onednn.png" alt="png" width="700">
OneDNN provides highly optimized routines for various deep learning operations, including convolution, pooling, normalization, and activation functions. By using oneDNN, you can expect faster execution times and better performance on modern CPUs, especially those with Intel processors.

In this project <code>os.environ['TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS'] = '1'</code> line sets an environment variable called <code>TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS to '1'</code>. This enables the use of Intel's OneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (OneDNN) optimizations for TensorFlow on the system where this code is being run. OneDNN is a high-performance library for deep learning that is designed to optimize the performance of deep neural network computations on a variety of hardware platforms. By enabling OneDNN optimizations, this code may run faster on certain hardware architectures that are compatible with OneDNN. <strong>In this project, the Conv2D and Dense layers will be automatically optimized using oneDNN, which should result in faster training and inference times on compatible hardware.</strong>

The <code>tensorflow.keras</code> module is used to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image classification. The model architecture consists of three convolutional blocks, each followed by a max pooling layer, and three fully connected layers with dropout for regularization.

Finally, the <code>model.compile</code> method is called to configure the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric for the model. The optimizer used is Adam, and the loss function used is sparse categorical cross-entropy. The model is also evaluated using the accuracy metric.

<!-- What it does -->
## What it does <img src="images/does.png" alt="png" width="30">
The garbage segregation project using AI/ML automates the process of identifying and sorting different types of waste. The system uses image recognition techniques to analyze images captured by a camera and machine learning algorithms to classify the waste into different categories. By accurately identifying and segregating waste, the system can reduce the workload on human workers, increase efficiency, and reduce environmental pollution. The project also promotes responsible waste disposal practices by making people more aware of the types of waste they generate and the proper ways to dispose of them.
