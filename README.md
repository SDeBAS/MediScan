This is  Team Health Heros, and we are pleased to introduce our project on Medical Prescription Handwritten Text Recognition utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), on Intel oneAPI server using Intel oneDAL and oneDNN.üë®‚Äçüíª. 

## üìö Project Overview

The "MediScan" project aims to revolutionize the process of interpreting and extracting prescribed medications from handwritten medical prescriptions. In the realm of healthcare, handwritten prescriptions often pose challenges due to potential errors in interpretation, which can lead to critical medical consequences. This project leverages advanced optical character recognition (OCR) techniques, coupled with machine learning algorithms, to accurately convert handwritten prescriptions into a digital format. By doing so, medical professionals can effortlessly access and verify prescription information, reducing the risk of medication errors and enhancing patient safety. The project will be developed in a collaborative and open-source environment, utilizing GitHub as the platform for community-driven contributions, improvements, and discussions. Through this initiative, we aim to bridge the gap between traditional prescription methods and modern digital healthcare, fostering a safer and more efficient medical practice. Join us in this endeavor to transform healthcare through innovation and technology.

We are confident that our project will benefit the environment and the community, and we look forward to presenting our findings and advancements in this field. 

## ‚ö° Motivation Behind our Project
The motivation behind the project stems from the critical need to address the potential risks associated with interpreting handwritten prescriptions in the healthcare domain. Handwritten prescriptions are prone to misinterpretation, leading to medication errors, adverse reactions, and compromised patient well-being. By harnessing cutting-edge optical character recognition (OCR) techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to provide a reliable solution for converting handwritten prescriptions into a precise digital format. This transformation not only streamlines the prescription verification process for medical professionals but also significantly reduces the likelihood of errors that could have serious health implications. By embracing technology to digitize prescriptions, we aspire to enhance patient safety, facilitate accurate medication extraction, and ultimately contribute to a more efficient and secure healthcare system. Through open collaboration on GitHub, we invite individuals passionate about healthcare innovation to join us in revolutionizing prescription practices and making a tangible impact on global healthcare quality.

## ‚ö° Outcome of our Project
The core idea behind the project is to create a seamless bridge between traditional handwritten prescriptions and modern digital healthcare systems. With the increasing complexity of medical treatments and medications, the potential for errors in interpreting handwritten prescriptions becomes a significant concern. This project seeks to leverage state-of-the-art optical character recognition (OCR) technology and machine learning algorithms to accurately transcribe handwritten prescriptions into a digital, machine-readable format. By doing so, medical professionals can effortlessly access, verify, and process prescription information, minimizing the risk of medication errors, drug interactions, and dosage inaccuracies.
